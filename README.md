# **SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT**

 In today’s competitive fashion industry, designers are looking for newer and better ways for designing apparel and launching them into the market. 

Designing new garments as per the preferences of the designer can pose a big challenge as the designer may run of out of new ideas for ready to market garment designs.  

Due to rapid pace of change in fashion trends, automated generation of apparel design has become popular. 

Using the generative adversarial network, we train the model with large garment dataset with which we expect to receive new garment designs.

**Back-end** 

•	Clone the repository https://github.com/Doraiswamy/Adaptive-Test.git into a separate directory.

•	Choose the editor of your choice. For example, PyCharm, Spyder etc. Note that this is not a compulsory step, it is only if you want to view the code.

•	Navigate to the ‘backend’ folder inside the ‘SystemCode’ folder.

•	An optional step is that you can set up a virtual environment to install your dependencies inside the project folder. This helps in avoiding mixing up of different environments. Please follow the link given here: https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/

•	Install all the dependencies for the project with the help of the command ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’.

•	Run the server with the help of the command ‘python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000’.

•	Navigate to the browser of your choice and in the search bar paste the following URL: http://localhost:8000 to check whether the server is running or not.
